### Questions related to this project
##### What is nullable in C# .net8.0?
    --- Nullable reference types allow you to express whether a particular reference type (like a class or string) is allowed to be null or not, helping to reduce null reference exceptions and improve code quality. 
    --- This feature enables the compiler to perform more thorough analysis of your code's nullability and provide warnings when potential null references are detected.
